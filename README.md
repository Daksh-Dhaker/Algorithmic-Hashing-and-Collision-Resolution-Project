# Algorithmic-Hashing-and-Collision-Resolution-Project
Executed a project focused on hash functions and collision resolution strategies, including chaining, linear probing, quadratic probing, and cubic probing. Designed a robust hash function capable of processing formatted string ABCD1234567 1234567890 (string length 21) identifiers and achieving a collision factor of approximately 0.3
